## Running Tests
```bash
# Run all backend tests
npm run test:backend

# Run integration tests only
./tests/integration/canister.test.sh

# Run specific test file
dfx canister call backend healthCheck
```

## Test Coverage Achieved ✅
- ✅ Patient management functions (registration, assignment, unassignment)
- ✅ Doctor management functions (registration, retrieval)
- ✅ Query lifecycle (submission, taking, responding)
- ✅ Authorization checks (fixed security vulnerabilities)
- ✅ Error handling (invalid inputs, missing data)
- ✅ System functions (health check, statistics)
- ✅ Edge cases and boundary conditions

## Integration Test Features
- **35+ test scenarios** covering all major functions
- **Security testing** for authorization fixes
- **Error condition testing** for robustness
- **Real canister deployment** testing
- **Automated cleanup** after test completion
- **Colored output** for easy result reading

## Unit Test Features
- **Motoko-native testing** for core logic
- **Mock data structures** for isolated testing
- **Function-level validation** testing
- **Type safety verification**

## Test Execution Flow
1. **Setup**: Deploy fresh canister
2. **Test Patient Functions**: Registration, retrieval, assignment
3. **Test Doctor Functions**: Registration, patient management
4. **Test Query Functions**: Submission, processing, responses
5. **Test Security**: Authorization and access control
6. **Test System**: Health checks and statistics
7. **Cleanup**: Stop DFX and clean up
