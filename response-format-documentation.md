## üîß **Response Generation Process**

### 1. **Standard Query Processing** (current):
```motoko
private func getAIDraftResponse(queryText: Text, condition: Text): async ?Text {
    let enhancedResponse = "ü§ñ **BaiChuan M2 32B Clinical Assessment**\n\n" #
        "**Patient Condition:** " # condition # "\n" #
        "**Query Analysis:** " # queryText # "\n\n" #
        "**CLINICAL ASSESSMENT:**\n" #
        // ... standard response structure
}
```

### 2. **Enhanced Query Processing** (with medical history):
```motoko
public func generateDraftResponse(queryData: QueryData, aiAnalysis: AIAnalysis, patientData: PatientData): async Text {
    var draftResponse = "Based on your query regarding '" # queryData.title # "', ";
    
    // Add risk assessment with medical context
    draftResponse #= "Initial assessment indicates: " # aiAnalysis.riskAssessment # "\n\n";
    
    // Add personalized recommendations
    if (aiAnalysis.recommendedActions.size() > 0) {
        draftResponse #= "Recommended actions:\n";
        for (action in aiAnalysis.recommendedActions.vals()) {
            draftResponse #= "‚Ä¢ " # action # "\n";
        };
    };
}
```
