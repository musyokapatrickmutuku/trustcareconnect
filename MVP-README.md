# TrustCareConnect MVP - Production Ready

## 🚀 Quick Start - One Command Deployment

```bash
./deploy-mvp.sh
```

This will:
- Deploy backend and frontend canisters to local ICP
- Initialize test patients P001 (Sarah) and P002 (Michael)
- Provide access URLs and next steps

## 🎯 MVP Core Functionality

### ✅ Real AI HTTP Outcalls
- **Function**: `processMedicalQuery(patientId, query, vitalSigns?)`
- **AI Model**: BaiChuan-M2-32B via Novita AI API
- **Real-time**: Actual HTTP outcalls, not simulated responses
- **Context**: Full patient medical history sent to AI

### ✅ Patient Context Integration
- Patient P001: Sarah Michelle Johnson (Type 2, HbA1c 6.9%, Metformin+Empagliflozin)
- Patient P002: Michael David Rodriguez (Type 1, HbA1c 7.8%, Insulin pump)
- Complete medical histories included in AI analysis

### ✅ Safety Assessment & Doctor Review Workflow
- Real-time safety scoring (0-100%)
- Urgency classification (LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH)
- **Doctor Review Required**: All MEDIUM and HIGH urgency queries
- **Direct Response**: Only LOW urgency (safety score ≥70%) bypass doctor review
- Critical symptom detection triggers immediate escalation

## 🧪 Testing the MVP

### 1. Access the Interface
```bash
# After deployment, visit:
http://localhost:4943/?canisterId=[frontend-canister-id]
```

### 2. Configure API Key
- Click "Show Setup" on homepage
- Set your Novita AI API key
- Initialize test patients

### 3. Test processMedicalQuery
- Click "Test MVP" button
- Use sample queries for P001 or P002
- See real AI responses with safety assessment

### Sample Test Scenarios

**Sarah (P001) - Type 2 Management:**
```
Query: "I've been feeling more tired lately and my morning blood sugars are higher than usual. Should I be concerned?"
Vitals: Blood Glucose: 180 mg/dL
Expected: MEDIUM urgency → Requires Doctor Review
AI Response: Generated but held for doctor approval
```

**Michael (P002) - Type 1 Stress Management:**
```
Query: "I'm having trouble with my blood sugars during college exams. They keep going high even with my pump."
Vitals: Blood Glucose: 220 mg/dL, Heart Rate: 85 BPM
Expected: MEDIUM urgency → Requires Doctor Review
AI Response: Pump adjustment guidance awaiting doctor validation
```

**Low-Risk Example:**
```
Query: "What foods should I avoid for breakfast?"
No vitals provided
Expected: LOW urgency → Direct AI Response (no doctor review needed)
```

## 🔧 Architecture

### Backend (Motoko)
```
packages/backend/src/main.mo
├── processMedicalQuery()     # Main MVP function
├── calculateSafetyScore()    # Real-time assessment
├── determineUrgency()        # LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH classification
├── initializeTestPatients()  # P001 & P002 setup
└── HTTP outcalls to Novita AI
```

### Doctor Review Logic
```motoko
let requiresReview = (safetyScore < 70 or urgency == "HIGH" or urgency == "MEDIUM");

if (requiresReview) {
    // Queue for doctor review - response held until approved
    return "Your query has been forwarded for doctor review"
} else {
    // Direct response for low-risk queries only
    return aiResponse
}
```

### Frontend (React/TypeScript)
```
packages/frontend/src/
├── components/MvpTester.tsx         # Direct testing interface
├── components/patient/              # Patient workflows
├── services/icpService.ts           # ICP integration
└── pages/HomePage.tsx               # Setup & testing
```

### Test Data
- **P001**: Sarah Johnson - 45yr female, T2D, HbA1c 6.9%, excellent control
- **P002**: Michael Rodriguez - 19yr male, T1D, HbA1c 7.8%, college student

## 🏥 Doctor Review Workflow

### Automatic Review Triggers
1. **MEDIUM Urgency** (Safety Score 40-69%) → Always requires doctor review
2. **HIGH Urgency** (Safety Score <40%) → Always requires doctor review  
3. **Critical Symptoms** → Immediate doctor escalation

### Direct Response (No Review)
- **LOW Urgency** (Safety Score ≥70%) → Direct AI response to patient
- Simple informational queries
- General dietary/lifestyle questions

### Sample Review Scenarios
- Blood sugar readings outside normal range
- Medication adjustment questions
- Symptom concerns requiring clinical judgment
- Any query with vital signs indicating risk

## 🔐 Security Features

- [x] API key stored securely (not hardcoded)
- [x] Patient data encrypted in stable storage
- [x] No sensitive data in logs
- [x] Rate limiting on queries
- [x] Input validation and sanitization

## 🌐 Production Deployment

### Local Testing (Current)
```bash
dfx start --background
dfx deploy --with-cycles 2000000000000
```

### ICP Mainnet Deployment
```bash
dfx deploy --network ic --with-cycles 10000000000000
dfx canister --network ic call backend setApiKey '("your-api-key")'
dfx canister --network ic call backend initializeTestPatients
```

## 📊 MVP Success Metrics

- **Safety First**: Multi-tier safety system with human oversight
- **Production Ready**: Real deployments should use environment variables

## 📞 Support

For issues or questions:
1. Check browser console for error messages
2. Verify dfx is running: `dfx ping local`
3. Confirm canister status: `dfx canister status backend`
4. Test API key: Use setup interface to reconfigure
